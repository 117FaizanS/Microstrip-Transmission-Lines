# Microstrip Transmission Line Design and Simulation

<h3>
What?
</h3>
A complete end-to-end design and simulation of passive RF components using microstrip transmission lines. This project focuses on optimizing impedance matching, minimizing signal reflection, and analyzing performance across key metrics like return loss and insertion loss.

<h3>
How?
</h3>
Used Keysight ADS to design, tune, and simulate:

<ul>
  <li>Microstrip lines with characteristic impedance, Z<sub>0</sub>, of 75 Ω and 50 Ω</li>

  <li>Low-pass filters</li>

  <li>Transmission line matching networks</li>

  <li>Power dividers and couplers</li>
</ul>

Validated performance through EM simulations, S-parameter analysis, and hands-on lab measurements using a microstrip trainer, VNA, VCO, and crystal detector.

<h3>
Results
</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Designed a matched 75 Ω microstrip line at 4.9 GHz with return loss > 21 dB and insertion loss ≈ 0.06 dB</li>

  <li>Built and tested a low-pass filter showing correct passband/stopband behavior</li>

  <li>Achieved impedance bandwidths up to 19.55 for TL-matching circuits</li>

  <li>Designed power dividers and verified output symmetry across 2.5–3.6 GHz</li>
</ul>
